# START-UP-BUSINESS-ANALYSIS-USING-REGRESSION
I was tasked in this project in microsoft learn to give some busineess decision insight on a bicycle rental business. The importance of choosing the right location is a common mantra for small business startups. But for a bicycle rental business startup, the right location is an especially critical factor in success. Bike renters are almost exclusively tourists or locals interested in pedaling their way through local tourist destinations.

If your area doesn't see much tourist traffic, a bike rental business probably isn't a realistic startup option. Mountain bike rentals may be an exception, but even then your local area needs to offer mountain bike trails and a thriving mountain biking culture if your startup is going to have a chance at surviving more than a few months. This project surveys a data obtained from a particular region to advise startup on a better time to launch bicycle rental business and other business suggestions that this project will expose.
